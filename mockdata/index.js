            "text": "Mr Dunne told Mr Barclay his committee's report had made 27 recommendations and the following February, in response, the government fully accepted one and part-accepted 22 of them. He wrote: \"The committee is disappointed to observe that while a number of our recommendations were accepted in whole or in part, the measures on which the government is currently consulting do not appear to implement any of them.\" When e-waste is disposed of incorrectly, toxic chemicals can leak into the surrounding environment, Mr Dunne added in a separate statement. \"The precious metals needed for our mobile phones, tablets or headphones are needed for net zero Britain and renewable energy infrastructure,\" he said. \"As a select committee, we are encouraged when the government looks carefully at the evidence we have collected and accepts our recommendations. We are yet to see many of these initiatives make it into policy or be reflected in its current consultation on e-waste.\" The letter urged the government to widen the scope of its consultation \"to ensure that the broadest possible proposals can be brought forward in order to move the UK to a zero-waste economy\". Among proposals in a government consultation on the issue - which ended on 7 March - were making producers of electrical goods more responsible for their collection and treatment when they reach end-of-life, as well as for the net cost of this. They would also require online sellers and retailers to offer a free collection on delivery service for bulky domestic electronics, such as washing machines or TVs. The committee said it was \"encouraged\" by this proposal, but that the consultation's overall scope was too narrow and did not address many of its recommendations. These included making online marketplaces, such as Amazon, follow the same rules as offline marketplaces in making sure the electronics they sell comply with UK law. The committee also recommended a requirement for producers of electronic goods to detail on its labelling a product's expected lifetime and how long it will receive software updates.",

            "title": "When wind turbine blades get old what's next?",
            "text": "The cranes moved in last year at Hagshaw Hill, Scotland's oldest commercial wind farm. They were there to continue the dismantling of wind turbines that had been generating electricity for the last 28 years. A similar scene can be witnessed across the world as the first wave of wind turbines built in the late 1990s and early 2000s are decommissioned. In the case of Hagshaw Hill, the existing turbines will be replaced with taller and more efficient ones that can generate up to 10 times more electricity. But working out what to do with the old turbines is challenging. Between 85 and 95% of a turbine's materials, such as steel, aluminium, and copper, can be easily recycled, but the blades are a different matter. Made of fibreglass they are covered with a tough epoxy resin, designed to withstand years of hammering by the elements. These durable qualities make breaking down the blades for recycling a tricky process. Traditional solutions include using pieces of decommissioned blades in cement kilns to manufacture cement, though this can be an energy intensive process. Blades are also commonly disposed of in landfill sites, but this option is becoming increasingly less feasible with a number of countries, notably Germany and the Netherlands, banning the practice. Innovative solutions such as repurposing blades into playgrounds or bike sheds have been shown to be effective at a local level but, with some experts predicting up to 43 million tonnes of wind turbine blade waste by 2050, there is a pressing need for a system that will work on a bigger scale. Scientists and start-ups are working on the problem, with many focusing on tackling the challenge of breaking down the materials used in the blades. \"At the end of life, if we're going to get any value out of the materials, we need to be able to separate the fibres from the resin in some way or another,\" Dr Claire Barlow, a sustainability and materials engineer, from the University of Cambridge tells me. One approach showing promise uses a technique developed by the University of Strathclyde. It involves breaking the blades down into small pieces and feeding them into a very hot air stream. The process separates the glass fibre from the resin. The glass fibre can then be collected, treated and reused, explains Malcolm Forsyth who leads Project PRoGrESS, which aims to commercialise the technology. The project, which kicked off in 2022, is working on a pilot plant that's due to be operational in the first half of this year - though it's hit some difficulties. \"The major challenge for the project team has been the rapid escalation of material costs partly due to the Russia and Ukraine war, as well as global inflation,\" according to Mr Forsyth. Similar solutions are being tested elsewhere that use different methodologies but have the same overarching goal of breaking down the materials used in wind turbine blades. Danish company Vestas, the largest wind turbine producer in Europe, announced last year an approach that uses a liquid chemical solution to break down the blades into materials which can then potentially be used to make new blades. A major advantage of this approach, according to Vestas, is that it uses widely available chemicals, though details haven't been disclosed. The process has the added benefit of not requiring energy-intensive high temperatures. Both of these traits hint at potential scalability, with the company claiming to have recycled 475 end-of-life blades in 2022. If technologies such as these succeed \"then not only can we solve the problem of new waste coming through, but we can also actually tackle historic waste,\" according to Dr Barlow. Historic blade waste currently in landfill could be recycled, as could waste which has been placed in storage awaiting a solution. At Hagshaw Hill a number of wind turbines have been kept in storage while ScottishPower Renewables decides what to do with them. Perhaps the future will be to make turbine blades that are easier to break down. A number of companies are working on building blades made out of materials less reliant on the difficult to recycle fibreglass and epoxy resin. However at this stage, the vast majority of blades continue to be made of these traditional materials. The next few years will determine whether the recycling technology under development can be scaled-up to a useful size, without harming the environment. As Dr Barlow puts it \"that really is the silver bullet.\"",

            "title": "Could product passports revolutionise the way we shop?",
            "text": "\"Every year across Europe, there are about 30 million mattresses that are at the end of their life,\" says Benjamin Marien. \"The vast majority of them end up in landfill or being burned.\" Marien is a director at Aquinos Bedding, which makes 1.2 million mattresses per year. The company uses pure polyester covers for most new products because it can be recycled, as opposed to a mix of materials that cannot be separated. \"You see more and more initiatives popping up for dismantling and recycling mattresses,\" he says. \"But that doesn't really help if the dismantler has no idea what the mattress is made of. That's why I'm very excited about the digital product passport.\" Digital product passports (DPPs) are being introduced across the EU to improve sustainability. They capture data about the environmental impact of products, their composition, their production and history. Industrial and electric vehicle batteries will be the first products to have mandatory DPPs, from 2027. Other product categories, including textiles, are expected to follow by 2030. \"The European Commission thinks that if the final customer is better informed, they can put pressure on the manufacturer and the distributors [to develop more sustainable products],\" says Dr Natacha Tréhan, an expert in procurement and the circular economy at the University of Grenoble Alpes. \"It'll increase eco-design. I'm very happy about this because 80% of environmental impact is determined at the design stage.\" A number of industry consortia, such as the Global Battery Alliance, are working on developing standards, including defining what should be included in the digital product passport and consistent definitions. \"It's impossible to do it alone,\" says Dr Tréhan. \"DPPs are a great example of the need to cooperate not only throughout your supply chain but also with your competitors.\" Aquinos is introducing digital product passports this year and expects to have one million mattresses tagged by 2027. The passports will be attached to the mattresses in two ways. There will be a QR code for consumers to scan so they can learn about where the mattress was made and what it was made from. The DPP could also hold warranty and washability information to help extend the product's life. Inside the mattress will be an RFID tag for recyclers to access the passport. It's easier to scan automatically, and it won't fade or get cut off. To introduce DPPs, Aquinos is working with TripleR, which specialises in digital product passports for bedding, and Avery Dennison, which offers an implementation service including hardware, software, digital ID technology and labels. \"We don't create new information as part of this process,\" says Michael Goller, senior director for atma.io at Avery Dennison. \"We integrate with existing systems.\" He adds: \"This is not something entirely new: QR codes, RFID and the cloud have been here forever. But applying a combination of technologies to a new problem drives innovation.\" Clothing brand Nobody's Child tested digital product passports in its autumn/winter 2023 collection. That collection used a broad range of suppliers and fabrics, and so gave the firm an opportunity to test the process. The company aims to ship all Nobody's Child products with passports by the end of 2024. \"The legislation lays out that a digital product passport needs to be something that lasts the duration of the lifecycle of the product,\" says Andrew Xeni, the founder of Nobody's Child. \"At the moment, the best we could get to, which is commercially viable, is a woven label, like a wash care label.\" Factories know how to apply it, he adds, and the carrier for the DPP can be a simple QR code. \"When you scan it, it takes you to a [web page] which is unique to that individual unit,\" he says. \"Not the style or size, but that actual one in your possession.\" Manufacturers will often have multiple suppliers for the same raw materials and components, so items that look alike could have different carbon footprints. The data in the DPP will reflect those differences. Mr Xeni expects that one day DPP data will have to be officially validated. \"The EU's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive is going to hold companies accountable for the integrity of the data they're reporting, including the claims on their digital product passports.\" For new building 100 Fetter Lane in London, architects Fletcher Priest and engineers Waterman have been asking suppliers to provide information for materials passports. The project, due to be completed this year, uses multiple layers of passports, from materials, through components, to the entire building. Passports cover structural steel, in-situ and precast concrete, and the raised access floor. Together, they are estimated to account for more than 80% of the building's mass. \"The precast elements on the façade have been designed with bolted connections, which allow them to be easily removed in one piece and reused in a different location, in a different configuration,\" says Mark Sutton, senior associate, Fletcher Priest Architects. \"At the end of the building's life, the materials are documented in such a manner that it will allow reuse in component form for precast elements and also recycling,\" he says. \"We expect that at that time there will be databases which are widespread and a marketplace for these materials and components.\" Circuland is a start-up that aims to create such a marketplace. Its co-founder is Anastasia Stella, who is also associate sustainability consultant for the Fetter Lane project at Waterman. \"By aggregating data from different buildings, there will be a publicly available material stock database to share key benchmarks for types of materials and different typologies of buildings,\" she says. \"When we have materials in our buildings that we don't need any more, their passports will be sent to the marketplace for used products where you can see their history. When the element is bought and used in another building, the same passport will be used for the new development.\" As well as supporting better buying decisions and helping with materials recycling, DPPs can support the reuse of products. Jarrod McAdoo is director of product at Ivalua, which provides technology to manage supply chains and procurement. In a previous role, he worked in the power generation sector and was responsible for sourcing discontinued spare parts for critical infrastructure. \"The chance of installing a counterfeit part was always so great,\" he says. \"Something like a digital passport would have made that process so much easier because you'd be able to see exactly where that part came from.\" To make a success of DPPs, he emphasises the need for large companies to support their supply chains. \"It's about how the individuals who have resources can help educate some of those lower-level suppliers who, maybe, are willing but don't have the necessary knowledge.\"",

            "title": "Your personal data all over the web - is there a better way?",
            "text": "\"From the beginning, I always meant for the web to be a platform for creativity and collaboration,\" says Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web. \"The first decade of the web lived up to that promise, but that's not what we've seen in the last 20 years or so.\" Sir Tim says a particular problem is the way personal data is handled. When you log in and store data in a website, it can only be used within that website. But an open source software project, called Solid, is designed to reverse that situation. The idea of Solid is that people have a private data store, and they get to choose which organisations can access it, for what purpose, and for how long. Called a Personal Online Data Store, or Pod, it gives users control over their data, and the freedom to combine it or share it between applications. Sir Tim is co-founder of Inrupt, a company that provides Solid-based technologies. He says using the technology would mean that data storage would be \"centred around people, instead of around apps\". Other companies providing Solid-based solutions include Graphmetrix and Digita. In Flanders, Belgium, Athumi is working on several projects using Solid. The company was set up by the Flemish government to help re-launch the economy after the Covid-19 emergency. The company acts as a neutral intermediary, connecting businesses in different sectors and enabling them to access sensitive company and citizen data. Athumi's first Solid project launched last year in collaboration with recruitment company Randstad, prior to a rollout with other recruitment firms. During 2024, Athumi plans to scale this application to 30,000 users. The application solves a common problem for job applicants in Belgium. They often have to submit copies of their diplomas, typically as photocopies by mail. Sometimes people struggle to find their certificates and getting replacements causes delay and costs money. \"We made the process very easy,\" says Björn De Vidts, chief executive of Athumi. \"The first step is to activate your pod. That is legally required because we cannot deliver services for a person who hasn't given us the authority to activate their pod. The second step is that you give permission to load your diploma into the pod. The third step is giving access to Randstad for a certain period of time to use the diploma in your pod for the specific job application.\" Citizens access and manage their pods through a web browser. For some roles, the recruiter needs to verify that the claimed qualification is genuine. This can be time-consuming when dealing with paperwork. In the Solid application, the diploma has a token that guarantees the data is authentic and hasn't been changed. The tech is also being piloted in healthcare. Starting this year, five Belgian hospitals will store information about hospital visits in patients' Solid pods. The idea is that it will make it easier for patients to share their medical data. For example, they could share proof of a recent medical examination when applying for a job, so they don't need to have another one. Athumi is also working with several media companies to create shared user profiles that span streaming services, so viewers can get better personalised services. The pods store data in standard formats, so that it can be reused in multiple contexts. \"What I call the real fun stuff of the data economy is when we will be able to combine these different data elements,\" says Mr De Vidts. \"That will generate use cases that we cannot even predict today. When you have enough interesting data points, application builders will, we believe, come to the pod to build new applications.\" Research commissioned by the Flemish government indicates that citizens would be willing to use the pods if they save time or money, or they help them to improve their health. The Flemish pods are hosted using Enterprise Solid Server, provided by Inrupt. John Bruce, Inrupt's co-founder and CEO, says you could have multiple pods hosted for you by companies such as internet service providers or travel firms you use frequently. All the pods can be accessed through one login. Pods could potentially make life harder for hackers. Even though pods may share a server, each one has its own access controls, set by the user. By contrast, a company database has one set of access controls that grants access to all customer records. \"Today you exist in big databases,\" says Mr Bruce. \"Your credit card is in there with 10 million others. \"That database is a high value target. [Hackers] will put months of work in to get that database. When the data value exists only in your pod, it is like the difference in the kind of attack one would get on a bank versus you getting mugged on the street. You're not going to get a team of people following you around for three months to nick your wallet,\" he says. Amanda Finch, CEO of The Chartered Institute of Information Security, says Athumi's plan to create a centralised data platform will have benefits. As well as easing the flow of data through the economy it could boost security. \"From a security standpoint, it should help to create a safer environment. With fewer platforms to secure, and responsibility lying with one, overarching party, you'd expect fewer vulnerabilities compared to multiple different solutions.\" She adds a note of caution, though, as the new architecture means citizens take responsibility for more sensitive data than they might previously have held. \"Putting security into the hands of users and citizens is a risk when you consider how many breaches have a human element,\" she says. \"If someone is duped into sharing their pod with a fraudster, then that's it - they've potentially lost everything. Users need to make their own conscious decisions on whether they share data. But this can only happen if citizens are educated on how they can reduce risk by instilling security best practices such as strong passwords or multi-factor authentication.\" Would all those companies used to hoarding data give it up easily? \"Companies don't want it,\" says Mr Bruce. \"If they could live in a world where they don't have to be responsible for your data, but they can have access to it, they'd take that in a heartbeat.\" Back at Althumi, Mr De Vidts thinks Solid could be the start of a data revolution. \"I've been working 25 years in B2B data collaboration, and this is the first time I've seen a data sharing technology that has this kind of potential to disrupt existing business models,\" he says. \"A citizen can decide what data goes to which consuming application. The data subject becomes the data controller.\"",

            "title": "Ocado warns M&S of legal action over food deal",
            "text": "Ocado has warned it may take legal action against M&S if the retailer does not hand over a final payment for their online food joint venture. The grocery technology firm and M&S signed a deal nearly five years ago for Ocado to sell the retailer's food on the internet. M&S made an upfront payment of more than £560m and is due to pay £190.7m based on certain targets being met. However, it is claiming that Ocado has not reached those goals. Ocado's co-founder and chief executive, Tim Steiner, said that the company believes \"we have a very solid case to get full payment, we know that M&S may not entirely share that view \". A spokesperson for M&S said: \"M&S remains committed to the turnaround strategy for Ocado Retail and our focus is on working with them and Ocado Group to deliver it. \"On the specific issue of the contractual contingency payment, our advice is that the financial performance of Ocado Retail means the criteria for the performance payment was not met.\" On Thursday, Mr Steiner said: \"We would much rather solve this in a nice and constructive way, which is what we're working towards doing.\"We are very confident that we are owed a substantial sum of money and ultimately I hope we will never get there but we will not walk away from that sum of money.\" The joint venture is owned 50:50 by Ocado and M&S. The deal was signed in early 2019 and went live the following year in September during the Covid pandemic when lockdown measures forced more people to shop online for food. In Ocado's full-year results, which were announced on Thursday, the company made a provision of £28m for the payment. Under accountancy rules, a business is required to show the \"fair value\" of an asset or liability. But Mr Steiner told reporters that the £28m estimated valuation of the payment from M&S was \"ludicrously low\". In Ocado's results, it said the sum \"is significantly lower than the amount that Ocado believes it will receive in the future - either via a formal litigation process or settlement\". Ocado admitted that its retail business had failed to meet the performance measures in the last financial year that would have triggered the automatic payment of the money from M&S, which is due this August. But it said that \"the contractual arrangement with M&S expressly provides for the target to be adjusted for certain Ocado Retail management decisions or actions\". For the year to 3 December, Ocado Retail reported sales of £2.4bn, up from £2.2bn in the previous year. The retail division generates the vast majority of the company's group revenue. The Ocado group as a whole reported a pre-tax loss of £403m compared a loss of £500m in the previous year. Ocado said that its retail division had grown the number of active customers and value of the average basket also rose, but people were buying fewer goods. The number of items per basket fell by 4.5% to 44 as \"customers managed their overall basket spend in the current high inflation environment\".",

            "title": "'HMRC gave me £49,000 tax relief, but wants it back'",
            "text": "Some small businesses that received tax breaks for their innovation work are now being chased to pay the money back. HMRC is reassessing past research and development (R&D) tax relief claims, after underestimating the level of error and fraud over many years. Business groups say the process is being \"mishandled\" and is \"crippling\" small firms. The tax authority said it has to make sure that claimants are entitled to the reliefs. It only seeks to recover money where it hasn't been claimed legally, it added. Dhruvin Patel is being asked to return £49,000 he got for his start-up. \"R&D relief was a great opportunity for innovating my business,\" says Mr Patel, \"but these retrospective challenges mean start-ups will actually shy away from innovating.\" Optometrist and entrepreneur Mr Patel, the founder of Ocushield, received the money in 2022 for work during 2020-21 on a potential new lighting product, a portable device which would project light that looked like daylight, even though it filtered out shorter wavelength blue light. In January 2023 he got a \"notice of enquiry\", informing him that a compliance check on his claim found similar products already in existence. Mr Patel says that the product he was working on was innovative at the time. He has almost finished developing it but hasn't brought it to market yet. The dispute is now going to arbitration. \"For start-ups like us it's time, resources, mental bandwidth and, if we lose, it's cash too,\" says Mr Patel. He knows several companies facing the same situation and the BBC understands thousands may be affected. Many small businesses have been in touch about this issue, according to the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). \"It's very clear that HMRC is mishandling its approach to past and present R&D claims in a way that undermines the innovative small firms who are needed if we are to grow our economy,\" says Tina McKenzie, policy chair for the FSB. \"The tax authority needs to recognise the importance of a predictable and supportive tax environment for those businesses at the cutting edge of technological change, which are increasingly small firms.\" Dom Hallas, executive director of Startup Coalition, a lobby group for tech start-ups, is aware of this trend too. \"These retrospective challenges on R&D tax relief are widespread in the start-up community and crippling,\" he says. R&D tax credits were introduced in 2000 and are designed to help start-up companies, by giving them tax relief when they invest in innovation. However, it has been reported that in recent years some companies have been abusing the system. HMRC has estimated that more than £1bn was lost to error and fraud in tax relief to smaller businesses at the height of the pandemic in 2020-21, the year Mr Patel made his claim. The National Audit Office spending watchdog recommended in January \"compliance work on older claims\" for the R&D scheme because HMRC had underestimated for years the level of error and fraud. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt committed to improve the functioning of the R&D tax relief system in the Budget, announcing a new expert advisory panel to support HMRC in the scheme. \"We've seen a rise in these retrospective enquiries in the past six months and they are scary for companies,\" says Benedict Conry, R&D tax lead at the law firm SeedLegals. He is not surprised that the R&D tax relief scheme has proved problematic to implement. It is not straightforward to claim, or administer, he says. \"It can be bewildering for start-ups and even some very experienced accountants don't understand it and won't touch it.\" One big problem relates to how you define \"innovation\", says Mr Conry. \"It can be very subjective and the grey areas quite large.\" All of this matters because if genuinely innovative start-ups can thrive, this will benefit the economy. But if some companies abuse the scheme to cut their tax bill, this takes money out of the public purse, which could otherwise be spent on things like hospitals and schools. HMRC told the BBC that it could not comment on individual cases, but said in a statement: \"We recognise the importance of R&D in driving innovation and economic growth and we are determined to ensure that the claims process is straightforward for genuine claimants. \"We have to make sure that claimants are entitled to the reliefs they claim and will only seek to recover money where it hasn't been claimed in accordance with the law.\"",

            "title": "CMAT: From Brit Awards to BBC 6 Music Festival, a new pop star has arrived",
            "text": "At one point during last weekend's Brit Awards, Clara Amfo was introducing the next performer when she glanced to her side and broke off from her script. \"Ooh, she'd better calm down!\" the co-host nervously exclaimed. Next to Clara, a woman wearing an elegant full-length black gown with balloon sleeves and bronze beehive had spun around to reveal that the back of her dress was a lot more revealing than the front. It had a large cut-out area exposing her back, plus the top half of her buttocks. The woman put a leather-gloved hand to her mouth in mock horror at her own exposure before breaking into a wide mischievous grin and exiting stage right, her mission accomplished. \"We've calmed down,\" Amfo confirmed, creasing with laughter. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. The woman was CMAT, the rising Irish singer who was nominated for international artist of the year. It was the sort of moment that people (mainly people who remember the 1990s) complain is missing from the modern Brit Awards - pop stars behaving badly. Or if not badly, at least cheekily. In this case, literally. CMAT's moment didn't quite spark the same tabloid frenzy as the last great pop star bum at the Brits - Jarvis Cocker's, being wiggled in the direction of Michael Jackson in 1996 - but it was an attention-seeking intervention, and it succeeded. Six days after the ceremony, CMAT proved she is worthy of attention for more than her outfits, stealing the show at the BBC Radio 6 Music Festival in Manchester, where she announced herself as one of pop's best new performers. The charismatic country-rock singer-songwriter's captivating set signalled that she's \"taking off to the stratosphere\", 6 Music DJ and singer Cerys Matthews wrote afterwards. Fellow presenter Stuart Maconie described it as \"one of the most brilliant things I've seen in years\". CMAT - Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson - started her career in Dublin, but the city was \"a wasteland\" for women trying to pursue music, she told 6 Music's Matt Everitt. \"I felt was that I was this tokenistic prize of property. The minute that someone found out that there was a woman singer-songwriter in Dublin, I was suddenly getting booked for every support slot under the sun because they wanted to make themselves look good by having a woman on their line-up. \"But they may not have listened to my music, and certainly I wasn't getting booked or encouraged to be a headliner.\" She moved to England - to Manchester because she couldn't afford London - but it wasn't a happy time and she still struggled. A turning point came when she got a place to attend a fan session listening to unreleased music by boundary-pushing pop singer Charli XCX. When it was CMAT's turn to give her views, she gave brutally honest feedback about the songs. It was enough for Charli to recognise she had musical nous. \"She pulled me aside afterwards and was like, 'Clearly you know loads about music, and clearly you're really talented, and you're not doing anything with your life right now. I don't know why but you should be doing far more than you're doing',\" CMAT told BBC Radio 1 last year. \"That is genuinely probably the most important thing that's ever happened to me. And I needed the person that I worshipped to give out to me and scold me, and that is what she did.\" After that kick up the now-famous backside, CMAT broke up with her boyfriend, moved back to Dublin, and reinvented herself. Her debut album If My Wife New I'd Be Dead came out in 2022, and the follow-up Crazymad, For Me was released last year. Despite encouragement from women like Charli, the music industry is still male-heavy. CMAT said it was \"is absolutely shocking and appalling\" that she didn't have a female producer or recording engineer on either album. But she told Everitt: \"In the words of Garth Brooks, everything that is a blessing is a curse. \"When you're a woman in a situation where there's a room full of men, there is a kind of 'sink or swim' thing that happens. You either allow men to walk all over you and talk all over you, or you learn really quickly and very aggressively to stick up for yourself. \"And I actually think that if I had been in a comfortable environment very early on, I may not have learned how to be the director of my own music and be the basically co-producer of all my records.\" The two LPs have already made her a superstar in Ireland, both going to number one, with the debut winning the Choice Music Prize for Irish album of the year. The follow-up was a painfully honest hangover from a messy relationship, its combination of regret and defiance laced with humour in off-kilter but fabulous pop songs. It was named the second best album of 2023 by the Observer and earned her a place on the BBC Sound of 2024 list, as well as the Brit nomination. Which brings us back to that outfit. She was, she claimed, making a \"political\" point as well as making trouble. She made sure the amount of bum crack on show was the same as the average amount of breast cleavage, which is seen as acceptable, she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour in the aftermath. Models and others have worn similar \"bumster\" outfits before, she pointed out. \"I think mine caused a stir because it's big and because I'm a size 14 as opposed to a size six, which is commonly what you do see on television especially when it comes to musicians and pop stars. \"I had a lot of people that were very angry that I would do such a thing. They were horrified, and people were really angry and aggressive in comments, telling me I had to go to the gym. The backlash was crazy.\" Speaking to 6 Music, she added: \"Loads of people in the comments are like, 'She's attention seeking! She's an attention seeker!' So? Yeah, that's my job!\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. YouTube content may contain adverts. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

At the station's festival, she grabbed the crowd's attention - whether by hurling herself around the stage with wild abandon, or body-popping with her keyboardist, or persuading several thousand 6 Music listeners to do a line dance during I Wanna Be A Cowboy, Baby! And she also commanded attention by simply standing still and holding hands with special guest John Grant on a scintillating duet of Where Are Your Kids Tonight, which showed off the operatic kick in her voice. The intoxicating show left the impression that a star had arrived, and that it won't be long before she's the headliner at last.",

            "title": "Cancer patients at risk from stretched NHS, says NHS complaints chief",
            "text": "Cancer patients could be at risk due to overstretched and \"exhausted\" health staff in a \"system at breaking point\", England's NHS ombudsman has warned. Rob Behrens' office carried out 1,019 investigations related to cancer between April 2020 and December 2023 - with 185 upheld or partly upheld. Issues included delays in diagnosis, treatment and pain management. The Department of Health and Social Care said record numbers of people had been treated in the last two years. Meanwhile recent analysis by the BBC revealed cancer waiting times in England last year were the worst on record. Mr Behrens, the parliamentary and health service ombudsman who investigates unresolved complaints against NHS England, said everyone deserves safe and effective care. He added: \"But patient safety will always be at risk in environments that are understaffed and where staff are exhausted and under unsustainable pressure.\" He called for concerted and sustained government action to ensure NHS leaders could prioritise the safety of patients. \"A key part of this is investing in the workforce, for today and for the long term, including providing full funding for the long-term workforce plan,\" he added. Problems investigated by his team included concerns about poor communication, end-of-life care and how complaints were handled. Most were about lung cancer, followed by breast cancer and colorectal cancer - some of the most common cancers in the UK. One investigation involved the death of Mrs Sandra Eastwood, whose rare cancer was not diagnosed for nearly a year, after scans were not interpreted correctly. The delay meant she missed out on the chance of very effective treatment that could have prolonged her life, according to the report. Mrs Eastwood, who lived in York, died in 2022, with a rare digestive system cancer called gastrointestinal stromal tumour. In June 2020 she went to hospital with abdominal pain. CT scans showed a mass which medics put down to a blood clot caused by medication she was taking for a unrelated heart valve replacement. The following May her symptoms worsened and she returned to hospital and was diagnosed with GIST. The report found that if Mrs Eastwood had been diagnosed earlier and scans interpreted correctly, the cancer might not have spread and she may have been eligible for surgery. John, her husband of 54 years, said: \"Sandra was wonderful. I worked away a lot when our two children were young and she did absolutely everything for them. She loved baking, making jams and chutneys, and travelling. The 79-year-old continued: \"I feel absolutely disgusted with the care she received from the hospital. They didn't investigate the scan results and just put it down to Warfarin [her medication] straight away. \"It seemed like the medical teams did not communicate with each other and everything felt very disjointed. They left her in agony for months before she died. \"The whole experience was very distressing, which is why I went to the ombudsman. I didn't want this to happen to anybody else.\" A spokesperson for York and Scarborough Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it \"fully accepts\" the ombudsman's findings and apologised for the distress caused to Mrs Eastwood and her family. The spokesperson added that the trust has made a number of improvements and agreed to change its practice following the case. Mr Behrens said: \"What happened to Mrs Eastwood was unacceptable and her family's grief will no doubt have been compounded by knowing that mistakes were made in her care. \"Her case also shows, in the most tragic of ways, that while some progress has been made on my recommendations to improve imaging services, it is not enough and more must be done. \"Government must act now to prioritise this issue and protect more patients from harm.\" The Department of Health said: \"The NHS has seen and treated record numbers of cancer patients over the last two years and cancer is being diagnosed at an earlier stage, more often, with survival rates improving across almost all types. \"We have invested £2.3bn into speeding up diagnosis and launched 154 community diagnostic centres across England. \"The NHS long-term workforce plan will boost the number of healthcare workers diagnosing and treating cancer, doubling the number of medical school and adult nurse training places.\"",

Elon Musk's SpaceX firm is taking the crew of three men and one woman in a capsule for a six month stay on the space station. Space is one of the few areas where the US and Russia continue to co-operate closely despite the war in Ukraine. They plan to do various experiments on the space station and one will involve growing artificial replicas of human organs in the low-gravity environment - which is not possible on Earth. The crew blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 03:53 GMT on Monday and the Endevour spacecraft is expected to dock at about 08:00 GMT (03:00 EST), before the hatch is opened and the newcomers are welcomed on to the ISS.
